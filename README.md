# MyAlfred

This is where I am keeping my Alfred 2 and Alfred 3 workflows. It is best to download the whole repository as a zip and then double-click on the workflow you want to install into your Alfred. The Alfred 2 workflows are provided as is and will not be updated or modified. This is due to not having Alfred 2 on my system anymore. I am strickly running Alfred 3 and loving it.
